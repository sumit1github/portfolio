The core application is hosted on AWS EC2, with seamless integrations to various AWS services to ensure scalability and performance.

                        -intensive operations like attendance processing are offloaded to AWS Lambda for asynchronous execution. Attendance and workflow applications push events to SQS, which are then processed by Lambda functions and persisted into Amazon RDS. This distributed architecture ensures optimal load balancing and high availability across the system.`,
